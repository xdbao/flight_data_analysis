ST2195 Coursework were completed in both R and Python. The results of the analysis were compiled in Report_ST2195_Coursework.

The 5 questions for the coursework were as follows:

1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

2006.csv.bz2, 2007.csv.bz2, airports.csv, carriers.csv and plane-data.csv were the datasets used. These datasets could be downloaded from 
the Harvard Dataverse at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7.
